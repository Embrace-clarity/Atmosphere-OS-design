# Contribute

## UI/UX Designers and Thinkers
If you want to contribute with design please follow the guide in [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/Embrace-clarity/atmosphere-os-ui/tree/master/CONTRIBUTE.md). Designs are also available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/fcWzLIlEwj8EqGplXKiIp310/Atmosphere-OS-v2?node-id=107%3A0) but please create an issue if you want edit access.

## Developers
If you feel like contributing code you might want to read through the [Whitepaper](https://github.com/Embrace-clarity/clarity-whitepaper) first. The project is in early stage so we need an Architecture of the OS. This is the [repo](https://github.com/Embrace-clarity/atmosphere-os) for you.

## Product Designers and Hardware Engineers
The renders we currently have are just concepts done in Cinema 4D. We need serious development in this area as well. Available [here](https://github.com/Embrace-clarity/clarity-device).
