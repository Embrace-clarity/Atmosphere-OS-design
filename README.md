# Atmosphere OS â€” Design
Atmosphere is an operating system free from the cloud. It is fully  decentralized and autonomous.
## Core Concepts
Instead of apps the system will have core layers (transportation, communication, payments, etc) on each layer developers and thinkers will be able to create modules. Modules will plugin within a layer and will enhance the experience of layer (ex. add uber module to apps). 

Each module will be supported by the community (support, bugs, ideas, development). Thinkers and developers will be able to raise funds via cryptocurrencies through the Module Store. Members(old term - users) of each module can contribute time to review or suggest ideas and report or fix bugs. Each contribution to a module will automatically reward members of the community. This way we break the chain if businesses consuming humans for profit. Instead value and ownership will be distributed to members instead to chosen few.

## Todo
- Cleanup the file (names, dead symbols)
- Brainstorm further to lock down a visual design language

### Long-term goals
- Full whitepaper
- Overall architecture of system
- Full specs of the functionality
- Make the design system module and ready for developers to create without the need of designers.
